ATO over ERTMS case study excerpt

A railway system is controlled using Automatic Train Operation (ATO) over European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) systems [1]. In this extract, a railway system is composed of a set of sub-systems with 4 grades of automation. With ATOoverETCSGoA1 the driver executes all driving functions manually. With ATOoverETCSGoA2 traction and braking are automatic but the driver ensures the environment monitoring and can switch towards manual driving if necessary. ATOoverETCSGoA3 allows autonomous driving with onboard staff that provides customized functions, e.g., open and closing doors. ATOoverETCSGoA4 allows completely autonomous driving without onboard staff. In this paper, we are interested in ATOoverETCSGoA2. This
sub-system is activated and deactivated by the driver, which implies the enabling/disabling of the Railway System. The driver is also responsible for switching driving mode between manual or automatic. The ATOoverETCSGoA2 is composed of two subsystems: On-Board and Track. The On-Board subsystem is responsible for executing the driving mode chosen by the driver
and updates the state of the Track sub-system with the current driving mode.
